                        who happened to run a record label, seeking tracks for a
                        compilation. With an immediate connection, the pair decided to
                        try their hand at making a song. That’s when they created their
                        breakout single, We Are Your Friends – a feel-good, funk-filled,
                        instant anthem that lost the remix contest, but won the attention
                        of Pedro Winter, director of the newly founded Ed Banger
                        Records, who boasted Daft Punk as former clients. One week
                        later, they were in his office, signing a record deal.
